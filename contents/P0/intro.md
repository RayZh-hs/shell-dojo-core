Back in the days when graphics are not prevalent, man interacted with computers using text-based interfaces we call **the commandline**. Users type in commands, which are interpreted by **the shell** before being forwarded to the underlying Operating System.

---

You might wonder why, in a time when GUI is commonplace, do we still need to learn the shell.

---

Primarily, as CS students, we frequently need to access low-level tools only available through the commandline. In addition, GUI is **slow**, which is why CLI(command line interface) tools are more often preferred by power users.

---

For many developers, **the shell is an art**. Mastering shell usage will boost your efficiency and deepen your understanding of computer systems. This is why we have developed this crash course:
> To bridge the gap of shell usage, and to help you become a more proficient developer.

---

In each level, you will learn new skills regarding shell usage or cli tools. Use what you have learnt to solve the challenges and obtain the **flag**, which looks like this:

```
flag{...}
```

Submit this flag in your browser to unlock the next level.

For this introductory level, here is your flag:

Best wishes, and may the shell always be with you.
